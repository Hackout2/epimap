GADM is a database of the location of the world's administrative areas. 

Administrative areas in this database are countries and lower level subdivisions such as 
provinces, departments, districts etc. GADM has been developed as part of the BioGeoMancer project. 

It was partly funded by the Gordon and Betty Moore foundation. The work was done at the Univeristy of California, 
Berkeley, Museum of Vertebrate Zoology, and the International Rice Research Institute by Robert Hijmans, 
Nell Garcia, Julian Kapoor, Arnel Rala, Aileen Maunahan, and John Wieczorek.
